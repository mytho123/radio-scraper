# radio-scraper

Scraps radio listing to csv files. These csv files can then be imported in a streaming platform thanks to software like https://freeyourmusic.com/ or https://soundiiz.com/.

## Status

The current version supports scraping radio listings from groupe 1981 (e.g. https://www.ouifm.fr/cest-quoi-ce-titre) but could easily be extended.
